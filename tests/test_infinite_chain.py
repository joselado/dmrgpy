"""Coverage for Infinite_Many_Body_Chain / Infinite_Spin_Chain (iDMRG,
pyitensor/idmrg.py) -- see infinitechain.py's own docstring for the
L/C/R-suffixed Hamiltonian convention this exercises.

There is no ED oracle for a genuinely infinite system, so these tests
cross-check via: the exact Bethe-ansatz Heisenberg energy density
(1/4 - ln(2)), a model-agnostic self-consistency identity (<H_uc> must
equal n_uc*e0_density by translational invariance, independent of
whether the *value* of e0_density itself is even known in closed form),
and a finite-chain-size extrapolation cross-check via ED (mode="ED",
so this needs no compiled C++ backend).

n_uc>=3 is out of scope for now (Infinite_Many_Body_Chain's constructor
raises NotImplementedError -- see its own docstring and idmrg.py's
module docstring for why), so only n_uc in {1, 2} is exercised here.

    a model-agnostic identity, true regardless of the specific model.

    Uses a moderately dimerized (gapped) chain rather than the uniform
    (gapless/critical) Heisenberg chain, and forces a fixed, generous
    number of macro-iterations via a near-zero etol rather than relying
    on the energy-density finite-difference stopping criterion: the
    *energy* converges quadratically in the wavefunction error and so
    reports "converged" well before IDMRGResult.U_list (built from the
    growing algorithm's raw per-iteration tensors, not yet a fully
    gauge-fixed periodic MPS) has settled enough for a *linear*-order
    quantity like this correlator identity to match tightly -- confirmed
    directly: the identical model/maxm with etol=1e-9's early stop left a
    ~1.8e-2 gap, while forcing the same run out to a fixed 150
    macro-iterations closed it to ~4e-4. Also confirmed directly on the
    exactly solvable fully-decoupled-dimer limit (J_weak=0) that the
    correlator formulas themselves are exact (both intra-cell and
    inter-cell/wraparound correlators matched -0.75 and 0 to machine
    precision there), ruling out a correlator-formula bug as the cause of
    the gap this test tolerates. DMRG never seeds Lanczos from a product
    state here (see CLAUDE.md), so the *size* of that gap varies
    noticeably run to run at fixed (maxm, maxiter) -- observed anywhere
    from ~3e-3 to ~2e-2 across different random seeds at this exact
    configuration -- hence the generous tolerance below; it still
    confirms the identity holds in the right ballpark and with the right
    sign, which a genuine correlator bug would not survive.

    maxm=8 (well below this model's natural, cutoff-set bond dimension of
    ~11-12) is deliberately small: it makes truncation land exactly on
    maxm on *both* the intra- and inter-cell bonds, avoiding a separate,
    real edge case where two independent SVDs (one per micro-step of the
    unit cell) round a borderline singular value across the cutoff
    threshold differently for what is, by periodicity, the *same*
    wraparound bond -- confirmed to happen intermittently at maxm=40
    (natural dimension 11 vs 12, one singular value short), which
    idmrg.py's _dominant_right_fixed_point now raises a clear
    RuntimeError for instead of a cryptic reshape crash (see its own
    comment) -- a real, documented limitation of reusing the growing
    algorithm's raw per-iteration U_list as a stand-in unit cell, not
